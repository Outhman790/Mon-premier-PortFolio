# My First Portfolio Project

This project is a personal portfolio website, created as our **first project in SOLICODE**, a programming school dedicated to developing skills in web development and other tech fields. It was built to introduce fundamental concepts in HTML and CSS and serves as a starting point for building more sophisticated projects in the future.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is a simple yet elegant way to showcase personal information and projects. The design is minimalistic, focusing on clarity and ease of navigation. Through this project, we aimed to apply basic web development skills to create a functional and visually appealing web page.

### Features

- **Profile Section**: Contains a profile picture and a brief introduction to the individual.
- **Projects Section**: Displays three sample projects with accompanying images, designed to demonstrate layout and styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for different screen sizes, making it suitable for viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.

This project helped us understand how to structure web content effectively and style it to create a cohesive user experience.

## File Structure

The project is organized into a few main files and folders:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file, containing the content and structure of the portfolio.
- `style.css` - The CSS file, which includes all styling for the layout, fonts, and colors.
- `profile__pic.png`, `profile__pic-removebg.png` - Profile images used in the header section.
- `project__1__img.jpg`, `project__2__img.jpg`, `project__3__img.jpg` - Placeholder images representing projects in the portfolio.
